#+TITLE:Molizaâ€”ELIZA in Modal

This is an attempt to recreate Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA (Doctor) script in [[https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/modal.html][Modal]].

* Getting started
- Clone the repo.
- Run the moliza.modal on the text of your question/statement.
- Watch Moliza respond.
- Repeat.

In case of [[https://github.com/aartaka/modal.ed][Modal.ed]], the only officially (and incompletely) supported implementation, the workflow is
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/aartaka/moliza
  cd moliza/
  ed moliza.modal -s < /path/to/modal.ed > moliza.ed
  ed -s moliza.in < moliza.ed
  # Newline appended
  # it has something to do with your problem
#+end_src

* Shortcomings
- Needs rest/tail/wildcard registers.
- Implies that there's at least one thing before the anchor words.
  - Original ELIZA had the zero-or-more words behavior, which is not reproduced here.
- Most Modal implementations run rules until there's nothing to substitute. The problem with Moliza is that many rules generate the text that can be rewritten again. So modal.c and multiple-pass modal.ed end up with either nonsensical result or endless loops. Restrict the number of passes your Modal implementation does!
